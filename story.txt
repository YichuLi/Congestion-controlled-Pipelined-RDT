It had turned out to be as good a morning as the weather forecast had promised. Olaf's first glance through the porthole on wakening revealed a clear blue sky with barely a wisp of cloud, a sultry heat-mist already forming that made the distant shore ripple while the sea itself remained majestically still, with only the barely perceptible rough-patch marking the reef's closest approach to the surface. They had anchored not long after sunrise, and while Olaf and Henrietta had slept, the Spanish-speaking Captain and Olaf's young safety diver Morris had studied the echo-sonde traces, eaten a light breakfast, and assembled all the equipment neatly on the rear deck ready for the dive. Olaf's camera gear and lights were neatly laid out behind his BCD and wet-suit. By the time he appeared from his cabin, having kissed Henrietta good morning (but, with an effort of will, left it at that) there was nothing more to do but suit-up and explain to Morris exactly what he had in mind.

"A beautiful morning, Morris, don't you think?" he began pleasantly.

"Perfect, I would say. Can I carry anything for you?" he nodded towards Olaf's special gear.
He turned and took a sheet of paper from the hand of someone off-camera to his right. "And finally, I've just been handed a breaking news story from Reuters. The mysterious black hole in the sky with which we began this special bulletin disappeared completely about ten minutes ago at 17.03 Greenwich Mean Time. Scientists say the phenomenon vanished in an instant, like turning off a light"Bottom Feeders
